# Cowpanion - helpful cow-based desktop companion & Webex bot

Tested on OSX, but should work on Windows...

## Installation & usage (client)

```bash
python3 -m pip install python-cowsay
python3 cowpanion-client/cowpanion.py
```

(You may also need to install tkinter/python-tkinter via homebrew if you have a
nonstandard python distro.)

## Configuration (client)

Settings & cow profiles are stored at `~/.cowpanion_profile`. Upon first run,
a default config will be written. New cows can be added by adding to the 'cows'
list.

## Installation (server)
